                    <p>
                        ePetCare is an innovative web-based system designed to streamline veterinary clinic operations and enhance pet healthcare management.
                        Our platform focuses on supporting small-scale veterinary practices by integrating essential features such as digital pet health records,
                        appointment scheduling, inventory monitoring, and client communication tools — all in one accessible system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We aim to empower veterinarians with a reliable management solution that minimizes manual work, reduces paperwork,
                        and ensures accurate and organized recordkeeping. At the same time, pet owners can conveniently access their pets'
                        medical histories, vaccination schedules, and upcoming appointments through an intuitive interface.
